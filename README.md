# Vim as IDE Replacement

This repository is going to serve as a checklist of the features I expect to add to Vim through plugins to provide an IDE like experience in order for me to be able to be comfortable developing in vim alone.

##PHP Development

I use PHPStorm as my primary IDE for PHP development.  The following PHPStorm features are what I would consider essential for my current PHP development and what I want to emulate in vim.

Features
- [ ] Jumping from files
- [ ] Creating code snippets with placeholders
- [ ] Multiple tabs for files
- [ ] Jumping to any method / property in a given class
- [ ] Limited global search
- [ ] Linting
- [ ] Autocompletion
- [ ] Creating files
- [ ] Renaming files
- [ ] Search for all occurrences of a symbol
- [ ] Search for all TODO comments
- [ ] Running tests (Currently done from the command line but make it so it does not interrupt the vim workflow)

##C/C++ Development

To be added.

##Javascript Development

To be added.

##Java Development

To be added.

##Python Development

To be added.

##iOS Development (Obj-c and Swift)

See if this is realistic.
